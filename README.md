# Insertion-Sort

Insertion sort is an algorithm used to sort a collection of elements in ascending or descending order. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to divide the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part.

Characteristics of Insertion Sort:

1. This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation.

2. Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values.

3.  sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

Insertion Sort Algorithm:

To sort an array of size N in ascending order: 

a. Iterate from arr[1] to arr[N] over the array. 

b. Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.

c. If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
